  "how_to_get_there_text": "As the event won’t take place in a traditional venue, your arrival will need to be a bit personalized. Parking will be available at the São Paulo Apóstolo Chapel in Rio Ada for those arriving by car. From there, it’s about 900 meters to the party venue, and a shuttle will be available to take you. No need to reserve the shuttle in advance; it will be running continuously. We recommend you take everything you need from your car as access isn’t simple.",

  "hot_to_get_there_from_jaragua": "Those coming from Jaraguá do Sul will know the way blindfolded. The quickest route is via Rio da Luz. The road isn’t always friendly, but for the skilled drivers in the family, it won’t be a problem. Other options include Garibaldi/Jaraguazinho or Pomerode.",

As her birth was scheduled for December 18, her father had planned a fishing trip. Thinking her mother was faking labor pains to stop him from going, he got angry and only planned to drop her off at the hospital. When they arrived, the doctor forbade him from going fishing.",

  "we_first_kiss_text": "It happened in Blumenau after a daring invitation from Diogo for dinner at his apartment. The menu was fillet mignon stolen from his mother and pasta with cream sauce. It may not have been my finest creation, but it was enough to win Raquele's heart through her stomach.",
  "we_first_came_to_germany": "Our first time in Germany",
  "we_first_came_to_germany_text": "Before we even started dating, Raquele already had plans to live abroad but hadn’t told anyone. Her mother kept advising her to talk to Diogo about it, but she calmly replied that everything would work out. When we finally talked about it, Diogo agreed without hesitation, and we both looked for internships. Diogo got one first, and then Raquele did everything she could to find one in the same city. By some magic of fate, we both ended up working in the same neighborhood in Stuttgart. We moved there in August 2018.",
  "we_got_engaged": "We got engaged",
  "we_got_engaged_text": "Diogo always tried to avoid the topic of engagement. Whenever it came up, he would try to change the subject. One day, we were in a restaurant overlooking the Cristo Luz statue in Guaratuba, PR. When someone asked when we would get married, Diogo quickly pointed out: 'Look at the Cristo, how it’s illuminated!' Since then, 'look at the Cristo' became the go-to phrase to avoid any engagement-related discussions. The proposal had to be different. I made her walk through Parque Lage in Rio while I took some pictures of her. I asked her to step forward, and when she turned around, I was kneeling with the ring in my hand. Since I didn’t say much, all she could respond was, 'What are you doing?' After we clarified everything, she accepted!",
